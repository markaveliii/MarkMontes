					Hello, my name is Mark Montes. I'm currently enrolled at Portland State University. At Portland State, our program focuses on the fundamentals of how programs work and expose us to the software engineering role. I've collaborated with many students to build projects for certain courses. I was also  SCRUM master for one of these group projects. The SCRUM master is the leading position of the group. This role gave me experience with being a leader and helped developed my communication skills further.
					I currently work full time as an IT Administrator at a company called Pentagon Technologies. In this position I have gained expertise in networking computers, managing servers, managing our database management system, writing scripts in various  languages JSL and Filemaker Pro, and various administrative skills.
					I aim to become a software engineer at PDX airport so that I can gain flying benefits to travel the world!

						<h2>Level-JJAMM</h2>
						<p>
							Level-JJAMM is a dungeon based speed-run type of game. It is a game that uses the curses library to make a cellular 2D environment.
							The objective of the game is to clear each level, where each level presents objectives such as moving enemies, find the key, or
							obtain the weapon. You can die as many times as you want in the game, but it records each of your deaths. It also records you time 
							and gives you those values at the end.
