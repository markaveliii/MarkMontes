					Hello, my name is Mark Montes. I'm currently enrolled at Portland State University (GO VIKINGS!). I said that last part ironically because I've never watched any of my schools sporting events. At Portland State, our program focuses on the fundamentals of how programs work and expose us to the software engineering role. I've collaborated with many students to build projects for certain courses. I was also a SCRUM master for one of our group projects. The SCRUM master is the leading position of the group. This role gave me experience with being a leader and helped me develope my communication skills further.
					I currently work full time as an IT Administrator at a company called Pentagon Technologies. In this position I have gained expertise in networking computers, managing servers, managing our database management system, writing scripts in various JSL and Filemaker Pros scripting language, and various administrative skills.
					I aim to become a software engineer at PDX airport because that's where my dad works. They have amazing benefits.
